## Pull Request Process
Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
Update the README.md with details of changes, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations etc.
Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is SemVer.
You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of one other developer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you.

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your contribution.

For example:

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me the action you have taken to solve it.

The description of the pull request should also state which issue it is resolving.
>  Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always look in the CONTRIBUTING.md - resolves #2

### Is it of good quality

* Reference variables mean something
* A good quality in sonarqube
* It reads well
